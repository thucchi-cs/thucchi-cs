# Hey! I'm Chi!

**I am a high school coder. I do a lot of competitive programming but also have been trying out some hackathons. I'm a programmer for the FRC robotics team 9428 Cashew Chickens. I'm also a part of Hack Club, attending ShipWrecked and the Athena Award soon! I do some random but cool projects so you should check out my repos and follow me!**

## Dave the Duck

### Who is Dave the Duck?
Dave is my mascot rubber ducky, as seen in my profile picture. He was given to me in my 9th grade year, and ever since, he's been with me to every competition, seen me receive every medal, helped me start every new project (but doesn't always finish), and traveled with me to every new city. Dave has been with me everywhere I go and can be seen on all my socials. Next time you see me, you should say hi to him too!

### Backstory
On a beautiful glorious day (it might have been raining but I have bad memory), the best coder in the world (me) arrived at the Technology Student Association 2024 National Conference. Curious, thrilled, and anxious all at the same time, she stepped foot in the tall grandiose ballroom where her state's meeting was held. Loud and excited chatter filled the room. Exploring and not fully aware of her surrounding, she bumped into another girl her age in offical attire. This moment might have seemed forgettable at the time, but it turned out to be a very key moment in her coding career. Quickly, she recognized the girl as Missouri's next TSA President. The girl introduced herself and handed out a small rubber ducky with sunglasses, and said "You can trust me to be your state president, I don't *duck* from responsibilities". This was when **Dave the Duck** came to life.
